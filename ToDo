To Do :

Clean up repo
- identify platform specific and IDE specific files that do not need to be on github and clean them up 
- add in .gitignore the files needing clean up

Refactor the existing code for better design
- seperate out the game logic from UI logic
- make the game logic reusable, such that maybe a jar can be extracted out of it which can be used for creating web applications later on.

Add functionality for puzzle generation

- see what constitutes as a valid and a solvable sudoku puzzle

Add functionality for solution generator
- back tracking single thread
